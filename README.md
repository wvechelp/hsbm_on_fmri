The provided scripts have been developed for the dissertation titled 'Topic modelling for the stratification of neurological patients' as part of the programme 'MSc. in Statistical Data Analysis' at Ghent University. The study aimed at exploring the applicability of hierarchical stochastic block models on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to cluster participants with known neurological disorders.

The repository consists of two parts: (1) data and (2) scripts. The data-folder is currently relatively empty and only includes some smaller data-files that were used for the main part of the written report. The remainder of the data can be found through https://zenodo.org/record/8024851 and contains both the original pre-processed data (participant-specific time series) and derived patient-pair matrices. The script-folder contains the R- and Python-scripts needed to generate the graphs depicted in the written report (mostly R-scripts) as well as to perform parameter inference through hSBM (mostly Python-notebooks). Note that these scripts were developed with Python 3.9.13 (to load the pre-processed data and to perform additional pre-processing), Python 3.10.12 (for model fitting and network visualisation in Google Colab), and R 4.2.2 (through RStudio, for visualisation).
